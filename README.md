## About

I am a sensory scientist: I research how humans perceive the flavors of food products.  I am particularly interested in the sensory perception of fermented products: cider, whiskey, kombucha, cheese, sourdough bread.  I also develop and adapt data-analysis methods for dealing with data from sensory-evaluation experiments, which is typically multivariate, highly correlated, and non-parametric (or parameterized in some unknown way).  These have lead me to become an enthusiastic (if clumsy!) `R` coder.  Most of the material you'll find linked here relates to learning or using `R` for analyzing these data.

## Research

My [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=f-3bd00AAAAJ&hl=en) is usually most up to date.  Most of my research is available as open-access preprints indexed through Scholar.
